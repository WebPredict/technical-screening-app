        <p><strong>How do I send a test to a candidate?</strong> Log in, go to your dashboard, 
  then click "New Candidate" and fill in the appropriate fields and save. The new candidate will appear in your dashboard. 
  Click 'Send Test' next to the candidate's name and select the test you wish to send.</p>
  <p>  <strong>How do I ensure a candidate does not cheat on the test?</strong> One easy and effective approach 
  is to have the candidate on the phone while they take the test, and view their screen in a web meeting while they are entering the answers.
  A more fool-proof approach would be to have the candidate appear in person to take the screening test.

    <p><strong>Why do I need to sign up to see question answers?</strong> 
  TechScreen.net is not designed to be a study tool for candidates (there are many, many good sources already out there for that); 
  it is geared towards recruiters / employers who want to screen candidates.</p>
  <p><strong>What does Difficulty mean for a question, and does it affect scoring?</strong> 
  At the moment, there are three basic quesiton difficulty levels you can specify for a question you create, 
  and the difficulty level does not affect scoring (it is for your own record keeping).
  </p>
  
  <p>
      <strong>What's the difference between a short phrase type question and open-ended?</strong> 
  Short phrase questions are intended for just that: questions with one or two word answers. 
  They can be automatically scored (whitespace and capitalization will be ignored in scoring, but not punctuation).
  Short phrase questions can be manually rescored if you believe the automatic scoring is in error for any particular question.

  Please send us an email in the <%= link_to "Contact Us", contact_path %> page and we will add it for you.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>Can I make my tests / questions public or private?</strong> Yes, for any test or question you create,
  you have the option of making them private (only viewable to you), or public.
  </p>
  <p>  <strong>How do I create a short phrase question?</strong> Log in, go to your dashboard, 
  enter the 'Create New Question' section and choice 'Short Phrase' for Question Type.
